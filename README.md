# ThesisAppendix

Three notebooks are attached. They include python code that was used to preprocess the data and coduct exploratory analysis (the first notebook, Thesis_1), implement the rolling window scheme, built the models, run them and save the results (Thesis_2), load the results and analyse them, including building graphs and printing tables that were later included in the work itself (Thesis_3).
